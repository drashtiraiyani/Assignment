                    <h1>Childhood</h1>
                    At the age of five, Lata started working as an actress in her father's musical plays.
                    After he died of heart disease when she was 13, Master Vinayak of Navyug Chitrapat movie company
                    took care of the kids. He helped kickstart Lata's career as a singer and an actress.
                    <br>
                    She moved to Mumbai in 1945 and started taking music lessons from Ustad Aman Ali Khan. Lata sang
                    "Paa Lagoon Kar Jori" for Vasant Joglekar's Hindi-language movie ‘Aap Ki Seva Mein’ (1946).
                    <br>
                    The new chapter in Lata's life was full of exciting opportunities and new endeavours, however it was
                    full of challenges too.
                    <br>
                    he singing legend came from a humble background and had to face a lot of struggle in her initial
                    years.. Losing her father at the age of 13 left a deep scar on Lata’s mind, and being the eldest
                    among her siblings, she had to bear financial responsibility early on in life.
                    <br>
                    Her mentor, Vinayak, lost his life in 1948, which came as a big blow to Lata. She was then mentored
                    by music director Ghulam Haider but struggled to find acceptance in the industry, and was often
                    criticized by producers for her Maharashtrian accent. As Urdu had a huge influence on the music
                    industry, Lata was forced to take Urdu lessons as well.
                    <br>
                    Lata's first breakthrough film hit came with the song "Dil Mera Toda, Mujhe Kahin Ka Na Chhora" in
                    the movie Majboor (1948) and the rest, as they say, is history.
